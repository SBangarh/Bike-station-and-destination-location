# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## This project was made possible because the the citybikes API, which can be found here: http://api.citybik.es/v2/

## Project/Goals
- To apply and practice python, and relevent libraries, with environment that resembles the real world.
- Practice pushing changes to github after every session or change as opposed to one big push at submission.
- Develop code that is clean and concise with the knowledge I have.
- Seek help when I need to and have exhausted all efforts.
- Accept that I need to explain my process to others in order to see the flaws in my methods.
- As always, have fun

## Process
1. Created the a remote repository (repo) on my github and cloned it to my local machine,
2. Created my goals for this project in no particular order, 
3. Did a initial run through of the project to determine a plan and identify areas where I may be strong or weak,


## Results
(fill in what you found about the comparative quality of API coverage in your chosen area and the results of your model.)

## Challenges 
- Connecting to the citybike api, seemed to be missing data initially. Results deviated from documentation

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
